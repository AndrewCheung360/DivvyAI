## Inspiration
The inspiration for DivvyAI came from our personal experience with the stress and panic of tackling a last-minute machine learning assignment. Just this past Friday, we found ourselves rushing to complete the assignments hours before the deadline. Despite knowing the workload ahead, managing our time effectively proved to be a challenge amidst a packed schedule of classes and other commitments. This experience made me realize the need for a tool that not only helps break down assignments into manageable chunks but also intelligently schedules tasks to fit into the small pockets of free time throughout the day. DivvyAI was born from the desire to prevent this kind of last-minute rush and help students stay organized and efficiently complete their assignments stress-free.

## What it does
With DivvyAI, we hope to solve the last-minute assignment panic that every student knows too well. Our AI-powered tool breaks down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks and integrates directly with course materials, offering references and resources to keep students on track. DivvyAI optimizes downtime, intelligently scheduling tasks into free moments between classes, meals, or meetings. Key features include automatic task breakdown, smart scheduling that fits assignments into your available time, and course-specific references for personalized guidance. With DivvyAI, students can finish their work ahead of deadlines, stress-free and organized.
